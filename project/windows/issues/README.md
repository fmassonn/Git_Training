# Prepare issues

In this chapter we will create the issues on Github to tell other developers in the collaborative project what are we going to develop.

Let's walk through a basic example together. We'll craft a small website. Then, we'll create multiple branches to experiment with different CSS styles. We'll compare the styles, choose which we like best, and integrate the favored styles into our "final draft" (that is, our master branch). You and your partners should begin following along at this time.

Github is a visual layer that works on Git. It displays graphically in your web browser all the information that Git provides: the ongoing developments, the track of the modifications, browse to any point in the past, ... and on top of that, allows to discuss issues in a forum format. We will centralise all developments in this portal. 

#### Exercise 4 – Open new issue in Git_Training project

*     Open the browser and go to the Github project Git_Training main page.
*     Issues .. + New issue .. Submit new issue.
*     Put the short name of your style (e.g. ceres01) in the title, write a full description and put the label “enhancement”.
*     Click on “Create issue”.
*     You can then see a list with all the issues. Each is assigned an #issue_number.
