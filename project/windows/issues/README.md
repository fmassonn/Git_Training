# Prepare issues

We will create an issue on Github to tell other developers in the collaborative project what are we going to do.

Github is a visual layer that works on Git. It displays graphically in your web browser all the information that Git provides: the ongoing developments, the track of the modifications, browse to any point in the past, ... and on top of that, allows to discuss issues in a forum format. We will centralise all developments in this portal. 

## Exercise 3 – Open new issue in Git_Training project

* Browse the Git project webpage (https://github.com/fmassonn/Git_Training)
* In the upper tab, click "Issues", then "New issues".
*  Let the others know that you intend to modify the file `twenty-five.html` by posting an issue. Be explicit, and do not hesitate to play around, tag people (@...), use colors, flags, labels, etc.
* Click on “Submit new issue”.
* Once your issue is published, everyone else in the room will know about your intentions, which is one of the basics of collaborative work.
