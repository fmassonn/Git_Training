# Git tutorial - session
We are going to do some exercises in this dummy project.

It is very simple, only consists in a HTML file and a CSS file and you will have to write some style definitions there. In the end the idea is to get a big HTML file with many `<div>` parts, each one in a different style.

In this tutorial you will learn how to make commits in the Git project, to create several branches, to push things to GitHub, and to follow a standard procedure to develop collaboratively. Afterwards, you should apply the same methods to any other collaborative development inside your department. The objectives will be achieved gradually following these topics:

1. [Set up your working environment](working_environment)
2. [Prepare issues](issues)
3. [Add new content](functions)
4. [Prepare branches](branches)
5. [Review and test others' branches](review)
6. [Pull master changes](pull_master)
