# Welcome to the Git Training!

Our goal in this project is to design, all together and collaboratively, an HTML web page that will display all 25 things that each of us should do before turning 25. The contents of the webpage will be directly inspired from the list available [here](https://gentwenty.com/bucket-list-25-before-25/). Since nobody wants to enter all 25 items - a long and painful task - , each of us will be responsible for adding one item.

We are working on a common project, so the use of a versioning system like Git is appropriate. This will allow to keep track of everyone's contributions and ensure their smooth integration within the workflow.

Concretely, we will proceed in four steps:

1. [Set up your working environment](working_environment) : we will retrieve the project from GitHub with TortoiseGit
2. [Prepare issues](issues) : we will let others know about your intention to add contents to the webpage
3. [Manage new content](functions) : 
    - we will actually add contents to the page
    - we will distribute your changes publicly, so that anyone can see them.
    - we will retrieve changes by others, to benefit from their work too.
4. [Manage conflicts](branches) : we will modify the style (colours) of the page, which will introduce conflicts, and see how Git manages those.

Each of the four steps will correspond to one practical exercise, where you will familiarize yourself with basic Git commands.
