# Create pull request

Our willing at this point is that our enhancements end up in the master branch of the project and that the responsible of the project releases a new version. Before doing so we need to go through a review and testing procedure. We don't want buggy code in our release. For doing so the first step is to create a `pull request`. In that `pull request` we can kindly ask a gentle collaborator to test our function.

#### Exercise 9 – Create a pull request in Git_Training project

*     Open the browser and go to the GitHub project Git_Training main page.
*     Pull requests .. New Pull Request.
*     Choose your source branch (e.g. “ceres01”) and target branch (in this case target is “master”).
*     Click on “Compare branches”.
*     Fill in title and description.
*     If any comment is needed put there. You can now take advantage to ask a collaborator (the person on your right) to test your function by using this technique
*     Assign to the project coordinator.
*     Click on “Submit Pull Request”.
