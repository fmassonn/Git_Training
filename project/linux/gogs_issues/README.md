# Prepare issues on Gogs

In this chapter we will create the issues on Gogs to tell other developers in the collaborative project what are we going to develop: a bash function to say Hello in a language of your choice from the table above.

Gogs is a visual layer that works on Git. It displays graphically in your web browser all the information that Git provides: the ongoing developments, the track of the modifications, browse to any point in the past, ... and on top of that, allows to discuss issues in a forum format. We will centralise all TECLIM developments in this portal. 

#### Exercise 4 – Open new issue in Git_Training project

*     Open the browser and go to the Gogs project Git_Training main page.
*     Issues .. + New issue .. Submit new issue.
*     Put the short name of your function (e.g. greetings_catalan) in the title, write a full description and put the label “enhancement”.
*     Click on “Create issue”.
*     You can then see a list with all the issues. Each is assigned an #issue_number.
