# Prepare branches

Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. Branches are instances of a repository that can be edited and version controlled in parallel. You can think of it like making an entire copy of your repository folder that you can edit, without affecting the original versions of your scripts.

## Exercise 5 – Create branch in Git_Training project

Go to the terminal opened in your workstation and 'cd' to the location where you cloned the project.

```
cd Git_Training
```

Create the new branch checking off from “master” branch.

```
git branch branch_name
git checkout branch_name
```

`<branch_name>` could be the name of the language you are working on (e.g. greetings_catalan).
